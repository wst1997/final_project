Hypothesis:

Sea ice concentration has negative correlation with sea surface temperature from 1982 to 2019.

Analysis Plan:

1. make a line plot demonstrating the anomalies of both sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration from 1982 to 2019

2. make a plot demonstrating global sea surface temperature in 1982 and 2019

3. make a plot demonstrating global sea ice concentration in 1982 and 2019

4. make a map plot demonstrating local sea surface temperature in 1982 and 2019 in special area for better reviewing

5. make a map plot demonstrating local sea ice concentration in 1982 and 2019 in special area for better reviewing

6. make a scatter plot with trendline demonstrating the correlation between sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration from 1982 to 2019
