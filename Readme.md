Hypothesis:

Sea ice cover is decreasing as sea surface temperature is increasing after 1990.

Analysis Plan:

1. make a line plot demonstrating the trend of mean sea surface temperature after 1990

2. make a line plot demonstrating the trend of mean sea ice cover after 1990

3. make a line plot demonstrating the anomaly of sea surface temperature after 1990

4. make a line plot demonstrating the anomaly of sea ice cover after 1990

5. combine the two plots above to compare the trends

6. make a map demonstrating sea ice cover distribution in 1990

7. make a map demonstrating sea ice cover distribution at present

8. combine the two maps above to compare the distribution
